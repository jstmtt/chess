# Chess Rapid Tracker

React dashboard that compares daily Chess.com rapid ratings for:

- `jstmtt`
- `addiprice03`
- `jessicasimian`

It fetches full rapid history from Chess.com public archives and auto-refreshes shortly after midnight.

## GitHub Pages note

This project sets `"homepage": "."` in `package.json` so built asset paths stay relative and work on project Pages URLs like `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.
